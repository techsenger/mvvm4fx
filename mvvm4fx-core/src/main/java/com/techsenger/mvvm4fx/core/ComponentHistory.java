/**
 * Represents a serializable snapshot of a component's {@code ViewModel} state. A history object stores only the
 * information that must persist between component sessions and excludes all transient or runtime aspects.
 *
 * <p>The {@code ViewModel} itself may contain both persistent and non-persistent values. It also defines default values
 * for all of its properties, regardless of whether they are stored in the history or used only at runtime. The
 * {@code ViewModel} owns the meaning of those defaults, while the history is responsible solely for persisting and
 * restoring the subset of states that are marked as persistent.
 *
 * <p>The history defines the persistent structure of a component and acts as a container for all states that should be
 * restored when the component is reinitialized. It is completely independent of the {@code ViewModel} and does not
 * contain default values or presentation logic. Default values belong to the {@code ViewModel}, while the history
 * merely reflects the states that were last saved.
 *
 * <p>It is the responsibility of the history to save and restore all persistent states of the {@code ViewModel} at the
 * appropriate points in the component's lifecycle. When the component becomes deinitialized, the current states of the
 * {@code ViewModel} are copied into the history. When the component is constructed again, the history restores those
 * states back into the {@code ViewModel}. This deterministic synchronization ensures a consistent mapping between the
 * runtime state and its persisted representation.
